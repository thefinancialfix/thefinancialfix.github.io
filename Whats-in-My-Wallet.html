          <p>
            Although I’m definitely a saver and NOT a spender, everyone needs to spend money – some for necessities, and
            some for fun. Groceries, gas, and textbooks are just some expenses that a college student like myself might
            incur. However, when spending money, I am careful and sure to save as much money as possible by utilizing
            multiple credit cards. This article’s sole purpose is to provide an overview of what I carry in my wallet,
            and an explanation of how certain cards provide me with certain benefits.
          </p>

          <br>
          <h2 class=“section-heading”>Cash</h2>

          <p>
            Let’s start with the obvious – cash. I usually like to carry anywhere from $60-$100 in cash on a day-to-day
            basis. Although I almost always use a credit card, you never know when you’ll need cash, so it’s always good
            to have some on hand. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been out with friends or out to eat and needed
            cash to make change or give a tip. I’m always sure to carry a few 1s and 5s so I can make change for just
            about any amount. It’s true that cash is king, so don’t forget to always have some on hand.
          </p>

          <br>
          <h2 class=“section-heading”> TD Bank Contactless Debit Card</h2>

          <p>
            I carry my debit card for one sole purpose, which is to deposit and withdrawal from a TD ATM. I’ll never
            make purchases with my debit card, as credit cards are not only more secure, but also earn points on
            spending. If I have the opportunity to pay with a credit card, I always will. My debit card pretty much
            collects dust in my wallet due to the fact that I rarely need to use the ATM. Just like cash, it is always
            good to have in my wallet in case I need quick access to cash. My specific debit card, the TD Bank
            Contactless Debit Card, is no different from any bank’s debit card (it does have tap-to-pay technology,
            which is cool, but again, I never use it). I will say, if you bank with TD Bank, it looks a lot nicer than
            the standard debit card that is distributed when you create an account with TD. Read more about this card

            <h2 class=“section-heading”>Chase Freedom Card</h2>
          </a>

          <p>
            Although I initially applied for the Chase freedom solely for the signup bonus ($150 cash back after
            spending $500), this card has proved to be very useful in my lineup. Starting in 2018, Chase started
            offering 5% back on gas twice per year for two quarters (this was the first time they offered gas for two
            quarters since 2012). The first and third quarter of the year are typically gas stations and something else,
            such as drug stores or streaming services. The second quarter has typically been grocery stores, which works
            great for me. As a college student, I spend on a weekly basis at the grocery store, so it helps to be
            earning a little cash back for spending that is already occurring, anyway. I typically spend anywhere from
            $100-$150 in groceries per month, so earning 5% puts a nice amount of money back in my pocket. The fourth
            quarter for this card is usually something like wholesale clubs or Walmart. The nicest thing about this card
            is that its categories do not overlap with those of the Discover it card. For example, While the Freedom
            earns 5% on gas for Q1 and Q3, Discover earns 5% on gas during Q2, which means you’re able to earn 5% cash
            back on gas for 9 months out of the year. Chase earns 5% on dining during Q2, while Discover earns 5% on
            dining during Q3, so you’re earning 5% on dining for 6 months out of the year. Moral of the story? This card
            works great in any wallet paired with <a href="http://refer.discover.com/s/ddjxzg" target="_blank">the
              Discover it Card</a>. You can <a href="https://www.referyourchasecard.com/2/EJGKLYIECB"

          <h2 class=“section-heading”> Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card/Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card</h2>

          <p>
            Although I have yet to use this credit card physically in person, the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature
            Card (or the Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card for those who don’t have Amazon Prime) is a must-have if you
            shop on Amazon. <b>The Amazon Prime Visa earns a whopping 5% back on all Amazon.com purchases.</b> Every
            time I order from Amazon, you can bet I’m using this credit card. In addition to a great savings on
            Amazon.com, this card also earns 2% back at gas stations, restaurants, and drugstores, and 1% back on
            everything else. When the Chase Freedom or Discover it isn’t earning me 5% back on gas in a given quarter,
            this card is my go-to for gas. Eventually, I intend to have a card that covers 5% back on gas for the
            entirety of the year, but cards with this specific perk are much harder to obtain. The card also earns 2%
            back on dining, which could come in handy if you don’t have a designated card for dining. Although this card
            technically has no annual fee, you must have a Prime account, which comes in at an annual cost of $119 ($59
            for students). NOTE: If your parent has an Amazon Prime account, you are eligible to enjoy the benefits of
            Prime at no cost with Amazon Household, a platform that lets you share a Prime account between family
            members. Luckily, because my family uses Prime, I get to enjoy this credit card (and Amazon Prime) at no
            annual cost. You can check out the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card <a

          <p>
            If you love Amazon as much as I do but don’t have a Prime membership, do not worry – there’s still a card
            for you. The Amazon Rewards Visa Signature is essentially the same card, minus the Prime aspect. With this
            card, you can benefit from the same great perks as the Prime version of this card, only the 5% you earn on
            Amazon with the Prime Visa card is knocked down to 3% with the standard version of this card. However, I
            still believe this is a great option, and an essential for those who shop on Amazon. You can check out the
            Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card <a

          <h2 class=“section-heading”>Uber Visa Card</h2>

          <p>
            The Uber Visa credit card is definitely a little more uncommon (and slept on), as I have never ran into
            anyone else with this card. Although it is not my everyday card, the Uber Visa is by far my favorite card in
            my lineup. Let’s start by answering the first question that might pop into your head – No, I am not an Uber
            driver, and no, you don’t need to be an Uber driver to own this card. This card earns <b>4% cash back on
              dining</b> and 2% back on online purchases (these are the only perks that pertain to myself). The card
            also earns 3% back on hotel and airfare, and 1% on everything else. Oddly enough, the Uber Visa card does
            not offer any special cashback for using Uber, but Uber is included as an online purchase, so you’re still
            earning 2% cash back while using the Uber app with this card. It’s great to have a card that earns 4% back
            on dining 12 months out of the year. Every time I’m out to eat, I know that I’m earning some solid cash
            back. If you’re going out to eat with friends, put the bill on your Uber Visa card and have them pay you in
            cash or on Venmo (I promise, the cash back adds up QUICK). I also use this card for any online purchases
            outside of Amazon.com. In addition to having great perks, this card has no annual fee, and currently offers
            a sign-up bonus of $100 cash back after spending $500 (20% cash back on the first $500 spent). You can check
            out more information on this card <a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/money/uber-credit-card/"
              target="_blank">here</a>.

          <a href="http://refer.discover.com/s/ddjxzg" target="_blank">
            <h2 class=“section-heading”>Discover it Card</h2>
          </a>

          <p>
            The Discover it card is a very solid card in my lineup, and I find myself using it for a good portion of the
            year. Upon getting approved for this card, Discover DOUBLES your cash back at the end of your first year. In
            other words, when you’re earning 5% back on rotational categories, you’re really earning 10% cash back,
            which is incredible. I used my cashback at the end of the first year to purchase a TV on Amazon, who gave me
            an additional 15% discount on Prime Day for using Discover! Additionally, This TV really had no out of
            pocket cost due to the fact that it was purchased solely using cashback. Similar to the Chase Freedom,
            Discover offers a rotation of quarterly categories that you can view <a
              href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cashback-bonus/cashback-calendar.html"
              target="_blank">here</a>. You also earn 2% for the first
            year on all other purchases (because of the doubled cashback), which returns to the normal 1% after the
            first
            year. The Discover it card was my first credit card and is a great way to start building credit while
            earning points simultaneously, all while paying no annual fee. I’d recommend the Discover it as a great
            starter credit card for anyone looking to start building a credit score. If you’re thinking about applying
            this card, <a href="http://refer.discover.com/s/ddjxzg" target="_blank">sign up using my referral link and
              we'll both

            I intend to write an individual review on each of these credit cards to dive into more specific information.
            Hopefully this article gives you an idea of how I use credit cards to my advantage to save a good amount of
            money over time (I’ve saved hundreds in just over a year by utilizing these cards). To read more about how I
            utilize credit cards, check out my article, <a
