            Roundhill Investments first caught my attention while watching Varney & Co. one morning. This same day, a
            16-year-old by the name of Kyle Giersdorf seemed to be all the hype of the morning coverage from Maria
            Bartiromo and Stuart Varney. Kyle is a professional Fortnite player, who locked in first place at the
            Fortnite World Cup, winning a prize of a slight $3 million dollars. Fortnite has over 250 million players
            worldwide. The company that created Fortnite, Epic Games, gave away over $30 million in prize money for the
            duration of the Fortnite World Cup. The “poor” kid that finished in second only won $1.8 million.
          </p>

          <p>
            So how did a 16-year old manage to generate more money in one moment than many will in an entire lifetime?
            The answer is through eSports, an ‘on-the-rise’ industry that is just heating up. Kyle is a team member
            of the Sentinels, a professional gaming team. After winning the Fortnite World Cup, Kyle has appeared in
            multiple interviews. He even earned himself and his shiny trophy a spot on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy
            Fallon. After Kyle realized he could make money playing video games, he turned his hobby into a full-time
            job. eSports are becoming increasingly more popular all around the world, including here in the US.
            Tournaments such as the Fortnite World Cup are viewed by millions (there are 454 million eSports viewers
            worldwide), and are televised just like any other sport. There are leagues and tournaments for many games,
            including Fortnite, PUBG, Halo, and Overwatch. The world of eSports has increasingly grown over recent
            years, and still possesses overwhelming potential to grow. If you’re like me and expect to see eSports
            marketed and televised as often as live sports in the near future, Roundhill Investments provides a great
            investing option to get behind the world of eSports.

          <h2 class=“section-heading”>Roundhill Investments and Their eSports ETF</h2>

          <p>
            As a registered investment advisor, Roundhill Investments operates with the goal of providing investments to
            a new generation of investors. Roundhill, focused on the current and future potential of eSports, has
            developed an index fund to track the growth of the industry. The Roundhill Bitkraft eSports Index (NERD) is
            Roundhill’s simple index fund composed of hand-picked eSports and computing companies, including Logitech,
            Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and even the headset manufacturer, Turtle Beach. The fund is composed
            of many US companies, as well as many foreign companies due to the popularity and demand of eSports
            overseas.
            In fact, the fund’s geographical holdings are almost evenly distributed between the United States and China,
            composed
            of 20.9% US companies, and 19% Chinese companies. You can view a list of holdings <a
              href="https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/secure/full-holdings" target="_blank">here</a>. Additionally,
            about
            50% of NERD (I love that the ticker is the word “nerd”) is comprised of companies with a market cap of over
            $5 billion. The other half of the composition is about 25% mid-market cap ($1-$5 billion) and 25% small
            market cap (under $1 billion). Since its launch on December 31, 2018, the ETF has been in the green. From
            the day the index fund opened in late December, the NERD ETF has shared uptrends and downtrends with the Dow
            Jones, something I always look for in a good ETF. This gives the index fund much more structure and
            security, due to the fact that the general market will always be positive in the long term. If the fund
            continues to mimic the Dow, this is great news.
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2 class=“section-heading”>Where I Stand</h2>

          <p>
            The YTD numbers for this fund are very good. Since its open 10 months ago, the Roundhill Bitkraft eSports
            Index Fund is up 21.09%, showing a steady pattern of growth so far. Like any good index fund, NERD is
            diverse, not only in company composition, but also in market by region, something you may not typically get
            out of an index fund.
          </p>

          <center><img class="img-fluid" src="img/roundhillChart.png" alt="" width="600"></center>

          <p>
            As of pre-market on October 25, 2019, the fund’s current price is 14.91, with a 52-week and all time high of
            15.92. As an investor in NERD, I am literally putting my money where my mouth is, as I have enjoyed growth
            from this ETF since investing in August.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re searching for a way to get your feet wet in a rapidly growing industry, the Roundhill Bitkraft
            eSports Index is the way to go. I am excited to track this ETF over the next few months as the eSports
            industry continues to produce growth. Visit Roundhill to learn more about the ETF at
