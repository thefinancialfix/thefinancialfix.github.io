            A few months ago for an online homework assignment, the class was required to review Disney’s
            statement of income, and state whether or not we could see potential/if we’d buy shares of the company. Not
            only did Disney’s financial data look great, but so did their fundamentals. At the time, DIS was
            valued at about $116 per share, and I had written in my response that I could very well see DIS exceeding the
            value of $200 per share in the next couple years. I explained how I loved a buy of Disney at the price of $116
            per share due to one standalone factor – the widely anticipated Disney+.
          </p>

          <p>
            Disney+ is Disney’s highly anticipated, brand-new streaming platform that launched just three days ago on
            Tuesday, featuring an overwhelming amount of content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National
            Geographic. With the battle between streaming services being extremely competitive, Disney swooped in at
            just the right time. Disney owns all rights to its content across streaming platforms, and has merged all of
            its hit movies and TV shows into one big repository.
          </p>

          <p>
            On Wednesday, Disney announced to the public that they have reported growth of more than 10 million
            subscribers since the launch of Disney+. This is more than 10 million subscribers in just a 24-hour period.
            This surge in subscriber growth has opened the eyes of analysts and investors, many left speculating what the
            future of this platform has in store for Disney’s revenue. Following this announcement, DIS shares surged,
            while shares of NFLX dropped significantly.
          </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Disney+ Audience</h2>
          <p>
            One of the reasons Disney+ is so successful (so far) is because of the different groups of people the platform appeals to.
            I would assume that Disney+ subscribers are grouped into two main categories – the current parents
            subscribing to the platform for their younger kids, and the 90s/early 2000s kids that grew up watching all
            of Disney and Pixar’s classics. If I were to bet on the subscriber data, I would assume these groups would
            account for the largest two groups of subscribers. The service is extremely popular among kids my age
            (18-25) and is also widely popular among families with younger kids in the household. Unlike other streaming
            services, not only is Disney+ kid friendly, but it also attracts young adults, too. You aren’t going to have
            parents subscribing to HBO for their young kids, but they might go out of their way to buy a new streaming
            service to watch with their children. This is where Disney+ poses a huge threat to competitors (especially
            considering its half the monthly rate of HBO). I have enjoyed every aspect of the service, and the content
            is much more than I could have imagined. I have been using the service since its launch, as Disney has
            partnered with Verizon to give certain customers free Disney+ for the first year. Disney has
            also created a bundle for $12.99 a month which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN. This will definitely help to
            draw in more adults and current Hulu users. A standard Disney+ subscription costs $6.99 per month, or $69.99
            per year if you pay for the year in full (an average cost of $5.83 per month, a savings of $1.16 per month
            and just about $14 per year when paying in full). Disney has done an excellent job in attracting multiple
            audiences, one of the reasons this platform will be so successful.

          <h2>When and Why I Bought DIS</h2>

          <p>
            I decided to buy a fairly large number of shares of DIS prior to their earnings report on November 7, 2019
            (I bought my shares the day before). This was more of an investment for me, not a swing trade, as I bought
            solely based on fundamental analysis on Disney’s short-term future. Last week after I bought, Disney’s
            positive earnings announcement increased the price of the stock the very next day. I bought just in time for
            a great earnings report, and the launch of Disney+ following the week after, which further increased the
            value of the stock. After the launch of Disney+, Disney announced over 10 million new subscribers in less
            than 24 hours, causing shares to surge over 5%. In addition to the earnings report last week and the launch
            of Disney+ this week, I am banking on impressive revenue numbers for the remainder of the year. A new Star
            Wars movie is being released in December, which will ideally perform well, as it is the last movie in the
            main saga. Additionally, Disney is a popular vacation spot for families around the holidays, as Disney
            offers an impressive Christmas display at their parks. With Christmas around the corner, a new Star Wars
            coming out, and Disney+ making its debut and being given a chance to perform, I am banking on some good
            revenue numbers. Disney’s next earnings report will be early next year, which will report on subscriber data
            and growth for Disney+. If revenue is high and Disney+ continues to perform as well as it has so far, Disney
            will blow earnings out of the water, and the stock price will certainly reflect it following their next
            earnings report. If you’re like myself and purchased DIS prior to their earnings report last week, as of the
            market close on 11/14/19, you’re up over 11% in just four days. Disney is up about 25% over the past year.  Even if Disney pulls back in the short term,
            I love Disney as a long-term buy given their current position.
