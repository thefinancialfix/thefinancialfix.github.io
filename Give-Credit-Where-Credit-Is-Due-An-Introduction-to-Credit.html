    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">

          <p>For a long time, my preferred payment method was cash or debit card, which is typical for a good chunk of
            consumers. I was always under the impression that credit cards are bad (and trust me, they can be) until I
            realized that a credit card is a tool that can save you a considerable amount of money in the long run. At
            first, I never found a need to get into credit cards, especially due to the fact that I consider myself a
            ‘saver’, and not a ‘spender’. However, within the past year, I have utilized credit cards in order to save a
            very good amount of money, over $300 in just a year to be exact.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Cash Back</h2>
          <p>I break my credit cards down into two different categories: everyday spending and categorical spending. In
            fact, one of my favorite cards, the
            <a href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cash-back/it-card.html" target="_blank">Discover it card</a>,
            covers both of these categories, but does much more. I will post a full review of the Discover It card on
            <i>The Financial Fix</i>, but for now, I will keep it short and sweet – this card is AWESOME. You can talk
            bad about Discover all you want, and about how they’re not accepted as widely as some other cards are.
            However, I have yet to run into a problem with using my Discover card. The Discover It card earns 1% cash
            back on all purchases, which is doubled at the end of your first year to earn 2% back on all purchases. What
            do you do after your first year is up? Get another It card (Discover allows you to have up to two of their
            cards at a time, but it is not a good idea to cancel one, because you are erasing credit history by doing
            so). Additionally, the card offers 5% back on
            <a href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cashback-bonus/cashback-calendar.html"
              target="_blank">rotational categories</a> such as gasoline and dining, which come out to be <strong>10%
              CASH BACK</strong> after your cashback is doubled. I love this card because you rack up cash back very
            quickly. Going out to eat with friends? Put the bill on your card during the 5% Dining quarter (really a 10%
            Dining quarter) and effortlessly earn cash back, most of which you didn’t even spend money to earn.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Sign-Up Bonuses</h2>
          <p>Another great way to utilize credit cards is to take advantage of sign up bonuses. Sign up bonuses are
            offers distributed by a credit card company that act as added incentive to apply for their card. Popular
            sign up bonuses are usually structured around the following: “Spend $500 within three months of opening the
            card and receive $150 back.” This sign up bonus gets the user 30% back on the initial $500 spent, which is
            MUCH better than paying $500 and receiving no cash back in return! I took advantage of a similar offer
            recently when I was getting work done to my car. I was spending over $500 dollars, so I applied and was
            approved for the
            <a href="https://creditcards.chase.com/freedom-credit-cards" target="_blank">Chase Freedom card</a>, which
            knocked $150 off of the total cost of my bill. In addition to using the card for its great sign up bonus, I
            can also benefit from Chase Freedom’s rotational categories, which like Discover, also includes a 5% quarter
            for gasoline. So, in other words, by utilizing the Discover It and Chase Freedom cards, I am earning 5% back
            on gas 6 months out of the year, which adds up to a good amount of money considering I travel frequently
            between home, work, and school.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Credit Score</h2>
          <p>If you’re unfamiliar with the term, you’ve probably heard the words “credit score” pop up in a conversation
            or a commercial. Credit score is extremely important in the long run, and can impact your ability to
            purchase a car or home. Credit score measures your creditworthiness. If you have a good credit score,
            lenders can more easily trust you. If you have a poor credit score, you might not be getting that low
            monthly payment that you were hoping for on that new car. As your credit history lengthens (the amount of
            time since you’ve opened a credit account) your credit score increases. Time is the best method of boosting
            credit score, along with other factors that will be discussed in future articles on <i>The Financial
              Fix</i>. However, every time you apply for a new card, you are basically authorizing what is called a hard
            inquiry. This is so the lender can take an in-depth look at your credit history and other information. A
            hard inquiry will result in a slight drop in your credit score, but don’t worry – this is only temporary.
            Boost your credit score by simply making payments on time, and not spending anywhere near your maximum
            credit allowance. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What's the Catch?</h2>
          <p>You might be thinking, “If credit card companies reward users with all this cash back, how do they ever
            make money?” This is the catch, and if you’re not responsible, this is where credit cards can become very
            bad. It is important (and essential) that you pay your statement in full at the end of every billing period.
            If you do not pay your statement in full, you will be charged interest on your owed money, which is
            typically extremely high for credit card companies. Although upon receiving a new card, usually there is no
            APR (annual percentage rate, which is interest) for a set amount of months, you should practice good credit
            habits and pay the statement in full when asked to do so. If statements are paid in full at the end of the
            billing cycle, you have nothing to worry about besides racking up rewards.</p>
          <p>Additionally, do not spend money just because you have a credit card. I can’t tell you how many people I
            know my age who have maxed out their credit cards just because they have money they’re able to spend and pay
            back at a later time. DO NOT go out of the way to spend money you wouldn’t otherwise spend just to earn cash
            back or rewards points. If you treat your credit card like cold hard cash, you will use it responsibly. </p>

          <p>Credit cards highly interest me, so much more to come on <i>The Financial Fix</i> on how to use credit
            cards to the best of your advantage. If you practice the above habits, there is no question you will be able
            to utilize credit cards as a tool to earn yourself extra money.</p>
