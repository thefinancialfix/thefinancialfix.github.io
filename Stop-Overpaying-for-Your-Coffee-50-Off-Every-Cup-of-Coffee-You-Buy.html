          <p>
            After waking up at 5:30 a.m. on Monday with nothing to do, I started doing some reading, and came across a
            platform called <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR" target="_blank">Cash App</a>. While a lot of you have
            probably heard of <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR" target="_blank">Cash App</a>, including myself, I
            wasn’t
            aware of some of the features and benefits the platform offers. This platform is a competitor of Venmo, but
            with
            extended functionality. You can send and receive money, transfer to and from your bank, spend with Cash
            App's free
            Visa debit card, earning competitive instant cash back (in the form of a discount, not a
            cash back system), and purchase stocks and Bitcoin (please, don’t buy Bitcoin). I made the decision that the
            <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR" target="_blank">Cash App</a> Debit Card could prove useful in my
            wallet for the various perks it offers. Let’s dive into some of
            <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR" target="_blank">Cash App</a>’s features:
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Send/Receive Cash:</b> This is the underlying backbone of <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR"
              target="_blank">Cash App</a>. Similar to Venmo or Apple Cash, you
            can send
            and receive money with your balance on the app, or directly from your checking account. You can
            also add funds with a credit card with a charge of 3%, so there is no point of doing so. I did not install
            the app to send money to people, as a majority of my friends are on Venmo. That being said, for this sole
            functionality, I
            will be sticking with Venmo. However, there are other areas where <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR"
              target="_blank">Cash App</a> shines.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Investing:</b> Truthfully, I don’t think anyone should utilize this app as an investing tool. There are
            so many more great options out there to begin investing with, such as TD Ameritrade, or if you’re
            looking for even more simplicity, Robinhood. Given that this feature has just been announced a couple days
            ago as of
            late October 2019, there isn’t much to discuss, especially because you have better platforms available to
            you at no charge.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Visa Debit Card and Cash Boost: </b> Here comes the best part. Additionally, as Venmo does, <a
              href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR" target="_blank">Cash App</a>
            offers a free debit card for every account. However, this is where <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR"
              target="_blank">Cash App</a> outperforms Venmo. <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR"
              target="_blank">Cash App</a>’s
            cash back program is superior to Venmo’s for its perks and high percentage back. Venmo has experimented
            with perks, such as 5% back at CVS or Chipotle for up to $20 in cash back. I assume this cash back
            limitation was put in place to eliminate buying a gift card at the respective store. For example, if you
            shop frequently at Trader Joe’s, you could buy a gift card for $400 and receive $20 back. Anyhow, Venmo is
            not currently offering any promotions or cash back incentives that go along with their debit card. It seems
            like
            their cash back offers are promotional for sign ups, or intermittent in general. Venmo’s lack of consistency
            regarding cash
            back is why my Venmo debit card sits in my drawer, deactivated, collecting dust.

            <br>
            <br>
            Enough about Venmo’s debit card – let’s talk about <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR"
              target="_blank">Cash App</a>’s Visa debit card, and why it is so much better
            than Venmo’s debit card. The sole reason I ordered this card is for its cash back perks. This customizable
            card utilizes a platform called Cash Boost, which allows the user to earn high amounts of cash back in
            specific spending categories. Only one cash boost can be activated via the <a
              href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR" target="_blank">Cash App</a> at once, and these
            boosts can be swapped out at any time. If you’re going to a location where your boost will earn you cash
            back, swap out your boost category for the occasion. Additionally, this card has an auto-reload feature,
            which is convenient so you can swipe your Cash Card without having to worry about if you have enough money
            in the Cash
            App to complete the purchase. If you were looking for one more reason to pick up this debit card, the card’s
            Apple Pay functionality is the icing on the cake - and we haven't even gotten to the best part yet.
          </p>

              <p class="copyright text-muted"><a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR" target="_blank">Cash App</a>'s Visa
                Debit Card's customizable design.</p>

          </center>
          <br>
          <p>
            To be honest, I ordered this card specifically for one boost, which is its boost at coffee shops.
            This card earns $1 off each visit to ANY coffee shop with a minimum purchase of $1.50. After your purchase,
            like any other cash boost, the $1 amount is immediately deducted from the cost of your transaction.
            Additionally, this
            boost can be used once every hour, which in my opinion is pretty fair. Think about this…the average cup of
            coffee at Starbucks in the US costs $2.75. With the <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR"
              target="_blank">Cash App</a> card, you are saving $1 every time you buy that
            same cup of coffee, which for a coffee that costs $2.75, means you’re receiving 36% cash back! Using this
            card to purchase a medium coffee at Dunkin’ will cost you just 89 cents! This means you're receiving over
            50% cash back off of the normal price
            of a medium coffee! Although I often brew my coffee
            at home, for me, this card will be extremely useful for its coffee shop boost alone. If you’re a person who
            buys coffee every morning (which isn’t the wisest thing to do financially) you’re going to save a good chunk
            of money with this debit card. If you want to save some money on a pretty frequent expense, it’s a no
            brainer.

          <h2 class=“section-heading”>Is the <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR" target="_blank">Cash App</a> Visa
            Debit for You?</h2>

          <p>
            I encourage you to check out more about <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR" target="_blank">Cash App</a>
            and its Visa debit card. If you’re looking to save on
            coffee alone, this card is definitely for you. However, the <a href="https://cash.app/app/XXRDWVR"
              target="_blank">Cash App</a> debit card also offers and has offered
            cash back in other competitive categories, such as the following:
          </p>

          -$1 off your purchase at any coffee shop
          <br>-10% off at Chick-fil-A
          <br>-15% off at Chipotle
          <br>-10% off at Panera
          <br>
          <br>Interested Yet?
          <br>
          <br>-5% off at Target
          <br>-5% off Airbnb
          <br>-$3 off each visit at AMC Theaters
          <br>-10% off at Trader Joe’s
          <br>-$2 off at Dominos
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>With so many solid savings options, this card could hold a nice spot in your wallet. If you frequently
            purchase coffee, or anything else from a coffee shop, I highly recommend using this card. This card covers a
            wide range of dining and entertainment categories, such as Chick-fil-A, Chipotle, and AMC. Although I never
            use a traditional debit card, a debit card with daily cash back (at over 50%) on coffee and frequent savings
            on dining will make its way into my wallet upon arrival. I plan on using this card along with its
            auto-reload feature, so I can spend as I please everytime I grab a cup of coffee without having to check the
            balance in the app and/or reload.
          </p>
