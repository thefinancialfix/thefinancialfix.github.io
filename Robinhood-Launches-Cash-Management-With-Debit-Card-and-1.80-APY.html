            A few months back, Robinhood announced they were launching a checking and savings platform, or cash
            management platform, which quickly fell through after Robinhood failed to obtain FDIC insurance. This would
            prove to be a problem in the long run, as to make this work, they would have to treat their checking and
            savings accounts as investment accounts to use SIPC insurance, a securities insurance, which wasn’t the best
            idea. Common banks are FDIC insured, which means that to release a banking platform, Robinhood should
            ideally be
            using FDIC insurance as well, as it has more extensive dollar for dollar coverage (Insured for up to
            $250,000 per depositor). SIPC insurance would prove to be a problem for getting money back quickly in the
            event
            of a financial crisis for Robinhood. Long story short, the insurance did not work out, and Robinhood
            cancelled cash management along with its 3% APY for the time being. Months later, Robinhood is back with a
            new offer on the table.

          </center>

          <p>
            Robinhood has newly announced its revamped cash management platform, this time firing back with 2.05% APY
            and FDIC insurance. Robinhood has attempted to create a lot of buzz by bringing back the platform, and they
            have done exactly that. However, they have recently announced that they would be decreasing the APY rate
            from 2.05% to 1.80%, apparently due to the Federal Reserve decreasing the federal funds rate. Although the
            fed does directly affect APYs for banks, I personally
            believe that this was all part of Robinhood’s marketing plan, and they intended to lower the rate after
            drawing in a substantial amount of users. They probably would have lowered the rate from 3% if cash
            management had worked out at the beginning of 2019. Introduce higher than usual APY, draw in a bunch of
            millennials, and then lower APY. Well played, Robinhood, but I can see what’s going on. So what does a lower
            APY mean? Nothing much, just a little less money per year, which isn’t the end of the world. Let’s take a
            look at Robinhood’s past APY offers compared to its current APY offer.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <b>
              Per Every $1000 Deposited:
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            3.0% APY - $30 during first year
            <br>
            2.05% APY - $20.50 during first year
            <br>
            1.80% APY - $18.00 during first year (current APY)
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Compared to a standard bank’s APY, all of the above numbers are a significant upgrade. However, it is a
            little
            disappointing to see a decreasing APY over the course of a year. It would be nice to see Robinhood stick
            with a flat 2.0% APY, of course if they could afford to do so as a company.
          </p>

          <p><br>
            Let’s go over some key features of Robinhood’s new Cash Management Platform:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Insurance</b> – Robinhood Cash Management is equipped with FDIC insurance for up to $1.25 million in
            funds.
            This is extremely important, as your money is just as safe as it would be in a standard bank.
            <br><br>
            <b>A More-Than-Competitive Interest Rate</b> – While most banks offer an interest rate well under 1% (TD
            offers
            .05%), Robinhood Cash Management offers a 1.80% APY, which blows away a majority of competitors.
            <br><br>
            <b>Debit Card</b> – The Cash Management portion of Robinhood offers a debit card with a selection of
            different
            designs, that can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted.
            <br><br>
            <b>ATM Access</b> – Access to over 75,000 in-network ATMs to withdrawal/deposit funds. These surcharge-free
            ATMs
            can be found in Wawa, Target, 7Eleven, and other convenience stores.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Other Brokerages Fire Back to Stay Afloat</h2>

          <p>
            With Robinhood previously being the only commonly known commission-free brokerage in existence, other
            brokerages
            view this as a concern, especially with Robinhood attracting the newer generation of traders and
            investors, while more traditional brokerages tend to target an older demographic. However, brokerages are
            beginning to compete in order to capture younger traders, and here’s how:
          </p>

          <p>
            Starting on October 7th of this year, Charles Schwab announced they would be launching commission-free
            trading for its users. Immediately following this announcement, TD Ameritrade lost nearly 20% of its value.
            Naturally, the only thing TD Ameritrade could do is join Schwab in eliminating commission fees. Fidelity
            followed Schwab as well, and the competition began. Within the near future, we will most likely see a
            competition between brokerages to see who can offer the most to both new and existing traders. Maybe we will
            see features such as referral links or fractional trading (the ability to purchase a stock at a fraction of
            its price per share) in order to increase appeal to the new generation
            of investors. Traditional brokerages will possibly attempt to appeal to younger users, or maybe Robinhood
            will even make
            moves in order to bring more advanced features to its platform, such as technical analysis features. Cash
            management with an included debit card
            is a great example of enhanced user functionality that Robinhood is bringing to the table.
          </p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>
            Will I Use Cash Management?
          </h2>

          <p>
            The short answer is yes (but no, but yes). Although I’ll be using Robinhood Cash Management, I will not be
            using Robinhood Cash Management as a “full-time bank”. I am a big advocate of banking with a company that
            has physical locations. This means I have access to in-person customer service, and instant
            deposits/withdrawals. I have banked with TD Bank for all my life, and have never had any issues, especially
            considering there are no fees or minimum balance requirements for students. Mobile banking platforms are
            seeming to get increasingly popular among the younger demographic. Platforms such as Chime intend to bring
            customers into the world of mobile banking, eliminating the idea of a physical banking location. However, I
            don’t want to lose the convenience of instant transfers, deposits, and in-person customer service, so I’ll
            be sticking with TD (which has
            a great mobile app). I will be using Robinhood Cash Management for one key feature: 1.80% APY. I won’t be
            transferring money in and out, and my direct deposits won’t be directed to Robinhood. I won’t be touching
            the debit card that comes with the account. However, I WILL be taking advantage of Robinhood’s
            higher-than-usual interest rate to store my emergency cash fund, money that would be sitting in my
            low-interest savings account otherwise, collecting dust. Although, I am disappointed because this 1.80% APY
            was originally supposed to be 3% APY months ago, which was bumped down to 2.05% more recently, and now is
            just 1.80% APY. The downside is that APY is subject to change at
            Robinhood’s push of a button. So although Robinhood promises the APY will go up if the fed cooperates, it
            could also be driven further down. Robinhood Cash Management is a great place to tuck away some money, maybe
            an emergency fund like the money I am putting away, that you don’t want to risk losing, but want to grow
            overtime. If you have
            cash sitting in your bank’s low interest yielding savings account, it is worth making the switch if you
            don’t actively use the money. I definitely will not make any transactions with the Robinhood debit card, as
            I always use credit cards to earn cash back. However, the savings account will prove very useful for money
            that I normally keep tucked away. Using your money to generate more, that's the name of the game, right?
          </p>

          <h2>
            Other Uses for Cash Management
          </h2>
          <p>
            <b>Seamless Transfer from Checking to Investing</b> - If Robinhood is your primary investing platform, I
            think Cash
            Management definitely has some use for you. If you are looking to invest directly with your paychecks,
            sending your direct deposits to Robinhood would make the process of trading/investing much easier by cutting
            out the process of transferring funds from your regular bank into Robinhood before being able to buy stock.
            I
            personally don’t use Robinhood as my primary brokerage, so setting up direct deposit wouldn’t get my money
            in the market any faster, and would serve no purpose.
            <br><br>
            <b>Primary Bank Account</b> – If you’re looking to transition into the world of mobile banking, Robinhood
            Cash
            Management is a great way to do so. Although I’m not a big proponent of online banking, it could be for you,
            so if you want to try it out, by all means, go ahead...you might love it!
            <br><br>
            <b>Avoiding Fees</b> – If you bank with a company that slams you with frequent fees, banking with Robinhood
            Cash
            Management will guarantee zero fees, unless you use an unregistered ATM. If I were forced to switch to a
            mobile banking platform, I would choose Robinhood. No monthly fees, no overdraft fees, and foreign
            transaction fees.
          </p>
