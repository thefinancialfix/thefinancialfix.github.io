          <p>
            Saving money in your younger years is not only recommended, but essential for growing your money through the
            later years. I always stress that the money you generate and invest/save in your teen years and 20s is the
            money that will lay the foundation for your portfolio for the rest of your life. Sometimes, however, life
            gets expensive, with expenses accumulating such as tuition, rent, car payments, phone bills, subscriptions,
            and more. Such expenses can pile on top of one another and create a hefty leak in your savings aspirations
            every month. However, when these expenses are accounted for and responsibly managed, your personal financial
            picture can become a lot clearer.
          </p>

          <p>
            By budgeting, we allow ourselves to spend a portion of our earnings, ensuring that every month when we spend
            a portion, we are saving a portion, as well. The goal is to be in a position where you are creating enough
            income on a monthly basis to not only cover your expenses, but save a percentage of your income, as well. A
            common budgeting method is the 50/30/20 rule. This is where we allocate 50% of our monthly income to “needs”
            (payments, gas, groceries, insurance, etc.), 30% into “wants” (shopping, dining, drinks, hobbies), and the
            remaining 20% into savings, such as investing in stocks or index funds, or high-APY savings accounts. Your
            budget becomes even more powerful when you are able to cut back in order to allocate LESS of your money into
            personal and monthly expenditures, and MORE of your money into savings and investing.
          </p>

          <br>
          <h2 class=“section-heading”>How To Plan Your Personal Budget:</h2>

          <p>
            To create our budget, we’re going to be brainstorming, coming up with numerous expenses and spending
            categories for a given period of time. In this example, we’ll be creating a monthly budget. The goal of this
            budget is to eliminate extraneous expenses and cut back to save some extra cash. I always prefer to set my
            budgets on a monthly basis, as each month will present itself with different financial needs, such as a
            vacation, or maybe an oil change. When I am preparing my budget, I use a five-step process. Unlike the
            50/30/20 rule, I don’t pay attention to percentages. My process is as follows:
          </p>

          <p><b>Step 1:</b> List & Calculate Recurring Expenses<br>
            <b>Step 2:</b> List & Estimate Variable Expenses<br>
            <b>Step 3:</b> List & Limit Personal Expenses<br>
            <b>Step 4:</b> Total Expenses & Monitor Budget<br>
            <b>Step 5:</b> Save or Invest Everything Else</p>

          <p>Now that I have listed out my steps, let’s take a more in-depth look at how my budgeting process will look
            for a given month…</p>
          <br>
          <h2 class=“section-heading”>Step 1: List & Calculate Recurring Expenses</h2>

          <p>The first portion of our budget is the money that we are going to be spending at a fixed rate every month.
            These expenses usually are not variable, or if they are, vary by very little, such as a gym membership or a
            phone bill. List out your recurring expenses, along with their costs. This is the easiest part of creating
            your budget, as these expenses are constant and regular every month, both in price and presence. In other
            words, every month they’re going to be there, and every month the cost will be the same. Below is an example
            of a recurring expense list for a given month:</p>

          <p>Rent………….....……...…...…$400.00<br>
            Gym Membership………..$11.00<br>
            Phone Payment…….……..$19.00<br>
            Haircut………………….........$30.00<br>
            Netflix……………….......……$7.99<br>
            Apple Music…..…….…….. $4.99<br>
            iCloud Storage…....…...….$.99<br>
            <b> Total.....................................$473.97</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            Just from listing out our recurring expenses, our finances are already more organized, and we can see at a
            glance that automatically every month, we are going to have to come up with $473.97 just to cover our
            recurring expenses. Now, when we look at our income on a monthly basis, we will know what percentage of our
            income is being allocated to our “needs”.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2 class=“section-heading”>Step 2: List & Estimate Variable Expenses</h2>

          <p>
            Now that we have listed out the month’s (and every month’s) recurring expenses, now we have to list out and
            estimate what I like to classify as variable expenses. These are going to be the expenses that are occurring
            pretty much every month, but varying in dollar amount. For example, gas is what I consider a variable
            expense, as you’re spending money on gas every month but in different amounts, depending on how much you
            drive. Utilities are another variable expense, as you are paying for them every month, but they vary
            depending on how much you use. Groceries could also be considered a variable expense, but we could also
            classify groceries as a personal expense, which I will discuss in the following step. There is no way of
            knowing how much we will be spending on variable expenses, so it is our job to estimate these expenses to
            the best of our ability. Overestimating tends to work out better, as if you spend less than you initially
            expected, you will end up with more money to save at the end of the month. Let’s take a look at an example
            of a varying expense list for our budget:
          </p>

          <p>
            Gas……………….…………...…$100.00<br>
            Utilities……….............……..$130.00<br>
            Groceries……………...........$200.00<br>
            <b>Total……......……..........……..$430</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            We now have a great estimate of what we will be spending in varying expense categories for our given month,
            and can hopefully beat spending expectations by spending less, gaining more money to save or invest after
            the month is over.
          </p>

          <br>
          <h2 class=“section-heading”>Step 3: List & Limit Personal Expenses</h2>

          <p>
            Step 3 is going to be the most important, and probably the most difficult part of setting your budget. This
            is where we’re going to be listing and limiting our personal expenses. Personal expenses include anything we
            love to do that isn’t necessary, or that we could technically do without. This will include categories such
            as dining and going out for drinks, entertainment, such as the movies, or any personal spending on yourself,
            such as ordering a huge haul from Amazon (we’re all guilty of it). Personal expenses are where we create
            holes for ourselves in our savings goals. When we let personal expenses go unaccounted for, we spend more,
            without knowing exactly how much we’re spending. To combat this, we want to create a list of every personal
            spending category we spend money in for any given month and set limits for these categories. For example, if
            you feel that you are typically wasting money by going out to eat too many times a month, you would want to
            limit your spending in that specific category. This way, once you spend let’s say $100 dollars going out to
            eat, you won’t be going out to eat for the remainder of the month (if you have the discipline to follow your
            budget). As I mentioned before, we could classify groceries as a personal expense if we wanted to. This
            would just mean we’re setting a limit on the amount of money we will spend on groceries if we find we
            excessively purchase extra groceries. Groceries could fit in as a variable or personal expense, depending on
            what fits best for your financial plan. Let’s take a look at an example of a minimal personal expense list,
            along with set limits for personal spending categories:
          </p>

          <p>
            Dining………………………$100.00<br>
            Drinks………………..……..$20.00<br>
            Entertainment…….…....$30.00<br>
            Personal Spending…....$30.00<br>
            <b>Total…………….........….....$180</b>

          </p>

          <p>
            Cutting back on personal expenses can especially be tough to adjust to. However, if you are looking to save
            money, the adjustments can be made, and you can teach yourself the discipline. For example, if you are
            really looking to save money during a certain month, maybe you’re not going to spend anything on
            entertainment or personal spending. Although this type of financial discipline does not come easy, it can be
            rewarding in the long run. Our personal expenses are set, and we are ready to total and complete our budget.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2 class=“section-heading”>Step 4: Total Expenses & Monitor Budget</h2>

          <p>
            Step 4 will involve not only adding up the different sections of our budget, but also monitoring our
            spending throughout the month, assuring that we do not overspend in certain categories. Let’s start by
            adding up each area of our budget, and seeing what we can expect to spend in a given month:
          </p>

          <p>
            <u>Recurring Expenses</u><br>
            Rent………….....……...…...…$400.00<br>
            Gym Membership………..$11.00<br>
            Phone Payment…….……..$19.00<br>
            Haircut………………….........$30.00<br>
            Netflix……………….......……$7.99<br>
            Apple Music…..…….…….. $4.99<br>
            iCloud Storage…....…...….$.99<br>
            <b> Total.....................................$473.97</b><br><br>
            <u>Variable Expenses</u><br>
            Gas……………….…………...…$100.00<br>
            Utilities……….............……..$130.00<br>
            Groceries……………...........$200.00<br>
            <b>Total……......……..........……..$430</b><br><br>
            <u>Personal Expenses</u><br>
            Dining………………………$100.00<br>
            Drinks………………..……..$20.00<br>
            Entertainment…….…....$30.00<br>
            Personal Spending…....$30.00<br>
            <b>Total…………….........….....$180</b><br><br>
            _________________________<br>
            <b>Total Estimated Expenses: $1083.97</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            After adding our recurring expenses, variable expenses, and personal expenses, we can expect to spend
            roughly $1084 in this given month. With a budget set, we cannot just spend aimlessly – we must track our
            expenses. Whether you use an app, or you record your expenses in a journal (I personally do both, utilizing
            a great app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moneycontrol-spending-tracker/id465909912"
              target="_blank">MoneyControl</a>), write down the amount you spent
            that per day or week, and what you spent it on. No matter how you accomplish this, you should know
            <i>exactly</i>
            what you’re spending. Now that you have went out of the way to create your own budget, you must make sure to
            stay within the restrictions you have created for yourself, and not overspend.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2 class=“section-heading”>Step 5: Save and Invest Everything Else</h2>

          <p>
            Now comes the fun part – coming to the realization that because you took the time to plan your spending, you
            are saving more money. Because you have accounted for nearly every expense in a given month, you can now
            take every penny of your excess income that was not allocated to expenses and save/invest it. Given the
            example we have been using, let’s say we are working with a monthly income of $2,000. This means we are
            spending:
          </p>

          <p>
            -$473.97 this month on recurring expenses, <b>24% of our monthly income.</b><br>
            -$430 this month on variable expenses, <b>22% of our monthly income.</b><br>
            -$180 this month on personal expenses, <b>9% of our monthly income.</b><br>
          </p>

          <p>
            With an estimated 55% of our income allocated to recurring, variable, and personal expenses, we are now able
            to take the remaining <b>45% of our monthly income and put it towards our savings and investments.</b> This
            is
            incredible! If this process is repeated from month to month, it will result in more-than-sufficient savings.
            This extra money saved at the end of every month should be invested in reliable stocks, or always-reliable
            index funds (more to come on selecting reliable index funds). If you are not yet ready to put your money
            into the stock market, until you are, you can park your money in a high-APY savings account, which should
            pay over 1.5% interest.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Why Are Budgets So Important?
          </p>

          <p>
            If you’re wondering why taking so much time out of your day to write up a budget is important, ask yourself
            why saving money to invest is important. Without investing, building wealth in order to create a successful
            financial picture becomes much more difficult. To prepare for later stages in your life, such as buying a
            car, buying a house, buying a second house, or retiring, you’re going to have to discipline yourself into
            creating a tidy savings plan. All of these goals and milestones have one aspect in common – they all start
            with a structurally sound budget. The person who sets aside a portion of his/her annual income to invest
            will be much better off in the long run than the person who saves none at all. The person who becomes aware
            of the importance of investing in their 20s will be much better off than the person who scrambles to put
            together a portfolio just years before retirement. Budgeting leads to saving money, which leads to investing
            more money, which leads to a secure, thought-out financial future. Shape your financial future, one monthly
            budget at a time.
