          <p>
            A Roth IRA is one of the best places you can put your hard-earned money as a young adult (or as an adult of
            any age). With a Roth IRA, you are taxed significantly less than a traditional IRA. By the time you add
            money to the IRA, you have already paid taxes on this money and are depositing after-tax dollars. Your
            money will grow over the years, tax free, and is able to be withdrawn at retirement, again, tax free. It is
            much better to get the taxes out of the way at a younger age, solely because you are currently in a lower
            tax bracket than you will be at retirement, therefore you are paying less in taxes than you would if you
            were taxed when you withdrawal at the age of 60. The moral of the story? <b>Withdrawals are not taxed.</b>
            This
            allows for significant savings.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can setup a Roth IRA through almost any major brokerage (TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, etc). I trade with
            Vanguard, but any brokerage that offers a Roth IRA will be just fine. For those of you that trade on
            Robinhood, they do NOT offer a Roth IRA. I personally would recommend TD Ameritrade, as they have a great
            user interface and offer a large variety of ETFs to invest in. You can check out more information on TD’s
            Roth IRA <a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/retirement-planning/ira-guide/roth-ira.page"
              target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Before you consider investing in a Roth IRA, especially as a young adult, consider the
            following:
            You are unable to withdraw your money without penalties until you are at least 59 ½ years old. Like most
            investing, you should be thinking long term, not trying to make a quick profit. If you are able to do
            without the money on-hand, it will grow significantly as you track your earnings over the years. You can
            choose to watch over your portfolio every day (like myself), or you could glance at it once a year if you
            wish - this is the great aspect of long-term investing. No matter how frequently you look, investing in an
            index fund that reflects the movement of the market as a whole will yield long-term profit. Vanguard offers
            a great lineup of ETFs (that can be purchased through any brokerage) that will move directly in-sync with
            the Dow. In future articles, I will always advocate the purchase of Vanguard index funds, as they track the
            general market’s movement and are a safe & secure option for long-term investing. Let’s go over some rules
            for the Roth IRA (via TD Ameritrade):
          </p>
          <p>
            - You must earn income to contribute
          </p>
          <p>
            - You may contribute up to $6,000 per year to the Roth IRA if you are under age 50
          </p>
          <p>
            - If over 50 years of age, you may contribute up to $7000 per year
          </p>
          <p>
            - Distributions are tax-free
          </p>
          <p>
            - Early withdrawal penalty is 10% (before the age of 59 ½)
          </p>
          <p>
            - You may buy and sell with no penalty as you please, as long as you do not withdrawal funds from the Roth
            IRA
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">How To Build Your Roth IRA in 365 Days</h2>

          <p>
            If you are under 50 years of age, the maximum contribution for a Roth IRA is $6,000 per year. This means
            that you may deposit no more than $6,000 into the Roth IRA on an annual basis. This being said, a true
            “killer” Roth IRA would include a maximum contribution every year. Here’s the plan:
          </p>

          <p>
            We need to set aside $6,000 a year to deposit into the Roth IRA. This can be accomplished by saving $500 a
            month. If this does not sound feasible, there are two options from here:
          </p>

          <p>
            1. Set a personal goal for a lower contribution for the year. If the maximum contribution of $6,000 is out
            of reach, set a smaller goal of let’s say $3,000, which means saving $250 a month instead of $500. Set a
            savings goal that you are comfortable with, but you still have to work hard for.
          </p>

          <p>
            2. If you don’t already, start working or pickup an additional part-time job. I can’t stress how important
            it is to be working and saving money throughout college. The younger you are able to invest your money, the
            more it will accumulate and pay off for you in the future. In addition to interning in software development,
            I work an additional side job, tutor, give piano lessons, and play guitar at restaurants. <b>Create as much
              income as you can in college.</b> I promise you it will pay off.
          </p>

          <p>
            Let’s say you are able to save $500 per month. Depending on your brokerage, you are going to have to pay
            some trading fees. I am one of the few lucky ones that has the privilege of trading with absolutely no
            trading fees, other than taxes, of course. If you are looking to trade with absolutely no fees, Robinhood
            might be a great option for you. However, we may start to see more and more brokerages eliminate trading
            fees in the near future, such as Charles Schwab. I know that I am personally not willing to pay $6.95 every
            time I want to add funds to my portfolio. If you’re adding $100 at a time, that’s roughly 7% of your initial
            investment out the window!
          </p>

          <p>
            If you save $500 per month and deposit into your portfolio at the end of every month, you will pay roughly
            $84 per year in trading fees (given you make 12 trades at $6.95 per trade). This is just over 1% of your
            initial investment, which isn’t too bad. If you deposit every other month, you will spend half of that in
            trading fees, which is roughly $42, under 1% in trading fees. If you deposit your funds into your Roth IRA
            twice a year, you’ll pay next to nothing compared to your initial investment. You must decide what will save
            you more money – waiting to invest and saving money in trading fees, or investing at the right time to
            generate gains that will offset the trading fees (you’re most likely better off waiting to invest and saving
            in trading fees).
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What to Do if You Can’t Part With Your Money Until You’re 60</h2>

          <p>
            It is very understandable that at a young age, you may want your money that you are investing to be readily
            available in case of a major life decision/emergency, such as purchasing a house or a car, or maybe getting
            a dog. In this scenario, I recommend using Robinhood. I will be writing an article in the future on
            Robinhood, but in the meantime, just know this – Robinhood offers commission-free trading that is
            withdrawable at any time. Robinhood appeals to millennials because of its simplicity and easy-to-use
            interface, making the process of investing a lot easier. You can still purchase the same index funds you
            normally would in the Roth IRA, only you don’t have to worry about being penalized upon withdrawing your
            money early.
          </p>

          <p>
            The key to building a true “killer” Roth IRA is not only reaching the maximum contribution for the first
            year, but continuing to add funds to the IRA every year thereafter. “Adding fuel the fire”, as I like to
            call it, is essential to growing your wealth. If you build a Roth IRA during the first year and then never
            touch it again, you will be rather disappointed with the results years down the road. If you deposit the
            maximum contribution on a yearly a basis, you will be impressed with the growth of your IRA over the years,
            I can promise you that.
