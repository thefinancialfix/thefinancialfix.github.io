          <p>
            Apple made its new credit card, offered by Goldman Sachs, available to all iPhone users on August 20, 2019.
            Since Apple Card was announced and launched just about four months ago, this credit card seemed to be all
            the hype among friends of mine, bloggers, YouTubers, pretty much everyone and their mother. After reading
            over the specifics of this card, I was left wondering, “Why?”
          </p>

          <h2 class=“section-heading”>The Apple Ecosystem</h2>

          <p>
            Before I talk about Apple Card itself, I’ll admit that I am one of many individuals embedded deep into
            Apple’s ecosystem. Apple’s multiple lines of products communicate seamlessly (for the most part) to create
            an easy-to-use user experience. I use Apple devices every day across multiple product lines, so it is safe
            to say that I am a hardcore Apple user.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Apple ecosystem includes product lines such as iPhone, iPad, MacBook, iMac, Apple Watch, AirPods, and
            more, running across operating systems such as MacOS, iPadOS, iOS, or Watch OS. Apple designs products that
            work together. Apple Card was made to be another extension of their already expansive ecosystem. In terms of
            revenue, this card is more comparable to Apple Music or Apple TV, their area of recurring, passive revenue.
            Apple managed to link this intangible concept of revenue to a tangible, stunningly designed titanium credit
            card that would go on to attract millennials like a cat chasing a laser pointer.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2 class=“section-heading”>Why Apple Card Might Make Sense</h2>

          <p>
            I can see why a consumer would want Apple Card in their wallet, as after all, it’s an Apple product, and its
            laser-etched titanium design is stunning. I constantly make fun of millennials’ obsession with pulling out a
            shiny, sleek credit card just to flex on their friends because I feel that sometimes this can definitely be
            the case. Online blogs literally list a card being made of metal as a “perk” of having the card (c’mon
            millennials, you’re making us look bad). However, there are other reasons Apple Card could make sense
            besides the looks. Let’s take a look at some of the specifics/perks:
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <b>- No Annual Fee</b> – There are no annual fees associated with Apple Card.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>- Daily Cash Back</b> – Cash back is quick to be rewarded through the Apple Card app.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>- Expenditure Analysis</b> – Cash back is quick to be rewarded through the Apple Card app.
          </p>
          <center><img class="img-fluid" src="img/appleApp.jpg" alt="" width="300">
            <p class="copyright text-muted">Apple's easy-to-use Apple Card interface.</p>
          </center>
          <p>
            <b>- Apple Pay Integration</b> – Cash back is quick to be rewarded through the Apple Card app.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>- 3% Cash back at Apple Stores and Apple.com </b> – If you’re a fan of shopping at Apple stores, 3% isn’t
            a bad amount to knock off the price of a new electronic/accessory.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2 class=“section-heading”>The Downside</h2>
          <p>
            Although this card has advanced spending analysis tools and almost instant cash back through the app, there
            is a price to pay for this convenience. In my eyes, you are literally losing money every time you swipe this
            physical card for day to day expenses. This card only earns 1% cash back when using the physical card at the
            store. There are plenty of other 2% cash back options out there for daily driver credit cards that beat
            Apple Card, such as the Citi Double Cashback, the PayPal Mastercard, or the first-year bonus of the Discover
            It card. Apple Card earns 2% only when using Apple Pay, so why not have a card that earns 2% both with Apple
            Pay and in person? For a yearly spend of $5,000, this is a difference of $50 between 1% and 2% cash back - a
            difference that is worth the switch. Although Apple Card offers some cool features through the app, I don’t
            see such features being extremely beneficial to myself. I let my cash back accumulate, so daily cash back
            would not be of much use to me. Additionally, I am very on top of my spending, so I do not need a breakdown
            of my expenditures. I’m sure this system will be beneficial to many users, but it simply isn’t relevant to
            me. The fact that there is currently no sign-up bonus is another downside, but this isn’t as bad as the fact
            that the card only earns 1% cash back. Although some will argue that the 3% back at Apple stores and
            Apple.com is competitive, chances are you can save more money buying your product/accessory elsewhere at the
            right time, such as a good deal on Black Friday or Cyber Monday. I especially don’t understand the use of
            this card for specific spending categories, such as gas or dining. If you care as much about cash back as I
            do, you could be earning at least 3% (and even up to 5%) back at the pump, and at least 3% back on dining.
            Earning only 1% in
            both of these categories by using Apple Card is a real deal breaker. But hey, at least its shiny and made of
            metal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moral of the story? Despite its eye-catching design and feel, it is definitely possible to get a better bang
            for your buck for your daily expenses through other credit cards.
