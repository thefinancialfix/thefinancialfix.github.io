            If you go back a few years, you will reach a period of time where Netflix was the big man on the block. At
            this time, there were no other serious competitors in the streaming industry, so you could say things were
            looking pretty good for Netflix with endlessly increasing subscriber counts, popular TV shows and movies,
            and the creation of original content back in early 2013. For years to come, Netflix dominated the streaming
            game. They even became a meme (“Netflix and Chill”), which actually, believe it or not, helped them gain
            publicity as a company among a younger demographic. As Netflix reached its peak value as a stock in July
            2018 at a price of 418.97 per share, things were looking great for both the company and investors like
            myself (Netflix was my top performing stock in 2018). However, things are beginning to heat up amongst
            different competitors, who are giving Netflix a run for their money. Take a look at the following stats (via
            <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NFLX/netflix/stock-price-history"
              target="_blank">macrotrends.net</a>):
          </p>

          <p>
            - As of the market close on September 20, 2019, the latest <b>closing price</b> for <b>NFLX</b> is
            <b>270.75</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            - The <b>all-time high</b> Netflix stock closing price was <b>418.97</b> on July 09, 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            - The Netflix <b>52-week high</b> stock price is <b>386.80</b>, which is <b>42.9%</b> above the current
            share price.
          </p>
          <p>
            - The Netflix <b>52-week low</b> stock price is <b>231.23</b>, which is <b>14.6%</b> below the current share
            price.
          </p>
          <p>
            - The <b>52-week average</b> Netflix stock price is <b>332.19</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you can see, Netflix isn’t exactly doing the best it could be since its price peaked in July 2018.
            Netflix now has some serious competition. The streaming wars has begun.
          </p>

          <p>
            Netflix is now battling with multiple streaming services, including Hulu, Roku TV, Amazon Prime Video,
            YouTube TV, the newly announced Apple TV+ (which is at an affordable rate of $4.99 a month as opposed to
            Netflix’s monthly rate of $12.99), and even an upcoming streaming service from Disney, which will be
            extremely popular among millennials due to its rumored selection of classic Disney content. All of these
            streaming services offer both competitive rates and content, leaving many wondering how much longer Netflix
            will stay afloat. The fact that Netflix hasn’t been performing as well, as well as losing subscribers in the
            states has raised the eyebrows of many investors, and not for good reasons. At the end of the previous
            market close on Friday, NFLX fell over 5%, over 15 points. Roku, a new-ish competitor on the market offering
            Roku TV, falling over 19% on Friday. While many see this as a buying opportunity, others view this as the
            start of a large downtrend among streaming services due to increasing competition.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Where I Stand:</h2>

          <p>
            Despite recent doubts about Netflix as a competitor in the streaming game, I believe Netflix is currently
            undervalued as a company, and I believe that Netflix will soon see better days. Is it possible Netflix
            begins to crawl back towards its 52-week low of 231.23? Absolutely. However, I will be holding my position,
            as I believe the next two quarters will produce some upward movement. Last January, Netflix saw nothing but
            gains as the stock market as a whole bounced back from a small period of recession starting in October 2018.
            With Netflix approaching the fourth market quarter, could we see a similar rebound to kick off 2020? All in
            all, even if Netflix continues to decrease for a short period of time, I view the short-term future as a
            great buying opportunity to buy before a large uptrend. Netflix has a lot to save its future and distinguish
            itself from other services, including the production of many popular Netflix Original Series’, such as
            <i>Stranger Things</i> and <i>The Society</i>. But, at the same time, other services are also offering great
            content, so
            subscriber counts over the course of a year or two will tell who wins street cred for America’s favorite
            streaming service. My bet is that there is money to be made after a short period of decline for Netflix.
            Time will tell what is in store for the future of the company as it battles against new competitors on the
            block.
